# Challenge: Customer Support Conversation Summarization with Azure OpenAI

**Estimated Time:** 2 Hours  

---

## Problem Statement
Modern businesses handle large volumes of customer support interactions every day. To enhance efficiency and improve customer experience, organizations must be able to automatically summarize customer-agent conversations and extract key insights.  

In this challenge, you will use **Azure OpenAI**, **Azure AI Language Studio**, and **Azure AI Speech Studio** to generate summaries from customer-agent conversations — both text and audio. This enables faster understanding, reporting, and decision-making for customer service teams.

---

## Goals
- Generate summaries of customer-agent conversations using Azure AI Language Studio.  
- Analyze sentences and create call summaries from audio recordings using Azure AI Speech Studio.

---

## Datasets
Use the following sample datasets for this challenge:  

- **Text dataset:** Sample customer-agent conversation transcripts (provided in the lab files).  
- **Audio dataset:** Sample audio recordings of customer calls (provided in the lab files).  

Ensure that both datasets are stored in your local directory:  
`C:\LabFiles\CustomerSupport`
